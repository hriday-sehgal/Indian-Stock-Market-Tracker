can you please build this using next js and node js for scraping  

please develop code that accomplishes the following:

    Continuously scrapes real-time market data from websites such as Moneycontrol, CNBC TV18, BSE, NSE, and Google.
    <The extracted data should include clearly identifiable tickers like Company Name and/or Sector Name.>

    Tracks the real-time price movements of stocks listed on the Indian equity markets.
    <The solution should allow users to specify the time interval for stock price updates.>

if scraping is not available then use free public apis and you can use python with fast api for api free that fetches data. Yfinance api or any other free api. 

if both of these not available then use mock sample data

build a good professional looking and good looking beautiful website for this with good styling using tailwind and ui librariess. make it simple not to complex also but easy to understand.
